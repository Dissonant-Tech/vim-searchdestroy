INTRODUCTION                    *searchdestroy*

This plugin provides idiomatic vim text objects that select the whole buffer.


MAPS                        *searchdestroy-maps*

                            *searchdestroy-<leader>sd*
<leader>sd     

In normal mode:

Prompts for new word, replaces all occurences of the  word under the 
cursor with the new one. Only matches the full word.

In visual mode:

Prompts for new word. Replaces all occurences of selected text 
with new word. If more than one word is selected prompts for text to 
be replaced, and for new text. Replaces all occurences in the selection.
                            
                            *searchdestroy-<leader>sda*
<leader>sda     

Prompts for a word or text to be replaced and for their replacement.
Replaces all occurences in the files in :args.
                            
                            *searchdestroy-<leader>ssa*
<leader>ssa

Prompts for a regex and then searches for it throughout vim using vim's
:vimgrep command.
